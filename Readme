#2) Dynamic Navbar

- dont care on content
  - ie logo on the left, links on the right
- media queries that make the navbar responsive
- at a particular breakpoint (610) display hamburger instead of links
- clicking the hamburger will open / close the menu showing the links

Advise:
-start with the pieces(html, skeleton, styles, media queries, js)
-dont get hung up in one place too long (move on until nothing's left)
